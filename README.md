# ObjectCloner
Designed to copy objects quickly and easily. To be able to copy, it creates a constructor at runtime, where all the properties of the input object are assigned. It supports primitive types, objects, arrays and lists. It also supports circular references or any level of deep hierarchy. Instead of using reflection, which has poor performance, it uses a type generator that builds the constructor through IL code.
